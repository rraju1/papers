# CHARACTERIZING ADVERSARIAL SUBSPACES USING LOCAL INTRINSIC DIMENSIONALITY

This is a paper concering the local intrinsic dimensionality. This doesn't seem to much of paper to hack through as there aren't many proofs. I just need to look for resources that kind of explain this phenomenon. They also give an algorithm which is pretty nice.
